# Welcome to my website, read everything before you use any links please I beg, 1 minute of reading from you protects this site from being blocked
## Notices *(IMPORTANT)*
### DO *NOT* USE THIS SITE IF A TEACHER IS WATCHING YOU ON SECURLY CLASSROOM (it will give you a notification when they start monitoring)
### ALWAYS CLOSE IT IF THEY OPEN CLASSROOM IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU SEE THE NOTIFICATION
### ALWAYS choose the option to run the game in an about:blank site (check the link in the searchbar, it makes it so that it doesnt appear in history and (im not certain though) I think it also makes it so teachers cant see)
